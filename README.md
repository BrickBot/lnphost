# lnphost
 A library supporting IR communication over the Lego MindStorms IR tower. It can be used from C programs on Posix compliant platforms, supports multiple protocols and is designed to be a replacement for lnpd.

Original Website â€“ http://lnphost.sf.net/
* Includes descriptive background information on both the Lego protocol and the BrickOS (formerly LegOS) protocol.

### Project Note
The project brickOS-bibo now includes the program ir-server, which may supercede both lnpd and this program.
